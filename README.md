## User Experience - UX

### User Stories

1. As a logged in user I can create posts so that I can share my choices of gluten free food and location with other users.

### Project planning

#### Agile Methodologies

##### Kanban Board

I have used the [project board in Git Hub](https://github.com/users/SofiaNords/projects/6/views/1?filterQuery=-status%3A%22Ready+for+Back+End%22) for my project planning. It has helped me to get an overview of the project and to see the progress. I added a column named "Ready for Front End" and one named "Ready for Back End", so when I was done with the Back End parts of the user story, I moved it to "Ready for Front End". In hindsight, I didn't need the "Ready for Back End" column because I started with the Back End part for all user stories. During the project I have chosen to hide this column to get a better overview of my Kanban Board.

![kanban](docs/images/kanban.png)

I also included Issues for tasks that are not directly linked to a specific user story, e.g. tasks linked to project planning and workspace installation, and labelled them "Setup etc.". 

![setup](docs/images/setup-label.png)

##### Milestones

My milstones in this project are:

- Project planning
- Back End
- Front End
- Testing
- README

since these large delimited parts of the project gave me an overview of how I was doing in broad terms.

![milestones](docs/images/milestones.png)

##### Epics

I categorised and labelled the user stories into the following epics:

![epics](docs/images/epics.png)

##### User Stories in GitHub

You can access User Stories in Git Hub [here.](https://github.com/SofiaNords/celiacs-api/issues?q=label%3A%22User+Story%22) In the picture below you can see how I've labelled them with epics and a label showing that it is a user story.

![comment a posts](docs/images/feature_9.png)

- When logged in, the user can click on a post to access the option to leave a comment.
- The user can edit and delete their own comments by clicking on the three dots to the right of the comment.

- When logged in the user can click on the "Sign out" icon to log out.

### Future Features

#### Messages in Selected Choices List
In the existing feature the Selected Choices List shows the same message whether you are logged in or not. In a future feature I would display different messages whether you are logged in or not. If you are logged out the message would say something like "Log in to view your Selected Choices List" while the logged in message would say "The list is empty for now. Please make your selections to add posts to the list."

#### Links in the About Page
In the existing feature you have to use the Sign in and Sign up icons in the Navbar to reach the Sign in page or the Sign up page. In a future feature I would add links to the pages in the text about "How It Works" and "Join Us".

#### Overlay trigger Comments
In the existing feature, when the visitor to the page hovers over the select button in the post view, they are informed that they need to log in to select a post. [See image here.](#post-page-when-signed-out)
In a future feature I would add a similar overlay trigger to the comment icon that says you have to log in to write a comment.

#### Selected Posts List
In the existing feature, the user has to refresh the page after selecting a post in order to see the post in the "Selected Choices List".
In a future feature I would add a useEffect function to update the component SelectPosts when the user clicks the select button. This way the page would not need to be refreshed before the title becomes visible in the list.

#### Selected Posts Count
In the existing feature, the list of selected posts does not show how many posts the user has selected. In a future feature I would display how many posts the user has selected to the right of the title. [See wireframe here.](#profile-page)

## Testing

[Test Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cT4z1t5p8EcwzSDX7WlpFXLf3zcVW32OgnlrwBf_hpk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Bugs

I noticed that there was no warning for when you have not filled in the username even though code for this has been added.

![warning sign in](docs/images/bug_1.png)
![warning sign in](docs/images/bug_2.png)

The same was true for Content in the form to create a post.

![warning sign in](docs/images/bug_3.png)

To solve this, I got help from Tutor Assistance to add the following controls to the handleSubmit function.

![warning sign in](docs/images/bug_4.png)

After that, I was able to add the corresponding controls myself in the function to create new posts.
